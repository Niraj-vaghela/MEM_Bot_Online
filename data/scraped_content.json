Although it can be worrying to see your pension affected by global markets, it\u2019s best to think of your pension savings in terms of decades, rather than months or even years. Most Nest members are unlikely to experience a significant impact to their final pension pot from shorter-term market falls. If you\u2019re young enough to ride it out, you\u2019ll have many more years to save into your pension and benefit as the markets recover.

The annual allowance for the tax year 2025/26 is \u00a360,000. However, if you are a high earner with annual earnings above a certain amount, your annual allowance for that tax year may reduce on a tapered basis to a minimum of \u00a310,000. This is known as the Tapered Annual Allowance. For more information, visit the [MoneyHelper](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/pensions-and-retirement/tax-and-pensions/the-annual-allowance) website. The annual allowance will apply to your Nest retirement pot. It\u2019s not a per scheme limit so it also applies across all your retirement pots with different pension schemes in which the contributions are paid by you, your employer or a third party on your behalf. It also includes any tax relief paid into the scheme. If you exceed the annual allowance in a year, you may need to pay an annual allowance charge. The annual allowance charge will be added to the rest of your taxable income for the tax year in question, when your tax liability is determined. For more information visit [HMRC\u2019s website](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/pensions-tax-manual/ptm051100) . You may be able to carry forward any remaining allowance from the previous three tax years to the current tax year. If you flexibly access your retirement pot from any pension scheme, you will have a reduced annual allowance of \u00a310,000 per year towards your defined contribution pension schemes. This is known as the Money Purchase Annual Allowance. For more information, please see [What is the money purchase annual allowance?](https://www.nestpensions.org.uk/schemeweb/memberhelpcentre/contributions/money-purchase-annual-allowance.html) As the annual allowance you use in any year is calculated using details from all pension schemes you contribute to, we suggest you consider taking advice from an independent financial adviser. You can get help to find a financial adviser on [MoneyHelper](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en) .

Aren\u2019t pensions like a savings account? It\u2019s important we invest your money, as it\u2019s our aim to grow your savings faster than inflation. Inflation means that goods and services become more expensive over time, so a basket of shopping worth \u00a310 today will likely cost much more in 20 years. We want the money you put away today to buy you the same, if not more, in the future, and our best chance of doing that is by carefully investing it. We publish [quarterly reports](https://www.nestpensions.org.uk/schemeweb/nest/nestcorporation/investment-approach/fund-factsheets.html) on where our funds are invested and how they\u2019re performing. They may be useful to help you see how your fund works. My fund has gone down \u2013 what\u2019s happened? It\u2019s never a good feeling to think that you\u2019ve lost out. With all investments, there\u2019s a chance your savings can fall as well as rise. For example, in 2020 and the Covid-19 pandemic and other events caused a serious dip in the market, with the FTSE 100 falling 34.4% in the first few weeks of the lockdown. However, our members\u2019 pots held up better than the markets because we spread your money across lots of different types of investments. Although markets generally go up over the long term, they rise and fall in the short term. The performance of your pot in any 12-month period will depend on when you paid money in and what the markets did after your money was paid in. That means if your annual statement had covered a different 12-month period, for example between January and December, you might have seen a different picture. It\u2019s also worth remembering that falls tend to be short term. As our members are invested with us for years, if not decades, we focus on long-term gains. Looking over the last five years, on average we\u2019ve delivered consistently strong returns while taking less investment risk with your money than other pension providers. We want to give you a bigger pension when you retire and we\u2019re putting all our effort into making it happen. What is Nest\u2019s approach to investing? We take a strategic, highly considered approach to investments and have some of the best risk-adjusted returns in the whole industry. That means we\u2019re likelier to help your pension pot grow while taking less risk. In fact, our team of in-house experts has received several awards for doing so, including Best Investment Strategy Award Winner at the Pensions Age Awards 2025 and Best Investment Strategy at the European Pension Awards 2025.

        "content": "Key points: This article tells you more about what happens to your money when it\u2019s invested with Nest. It explains the types of events that cause uncertainty in the markets and could have a short-term effect on your pension savings.\nWhat happens to my pot when there\u2019s uncertainty in the financial markets? Like all pensions, your Nest pension pot is invested in lots of financial markets like stocks, shares, property and much more. We pick markets that generally rise in price over the years, choosing the ones we think will make money for you over the years, if not decades that you\u2019re saving with us. These long-term rises in price are occasionally interrupted by events that create uncertainty \u2013 like rises in national interest rates, energy shortages, global conflict, pandemics and political crises. This uncertainty can sometimes cause the price of some financial markets to rise and fall unexpectedly, which could affect how much you have in your pension pot. Once the short-term uncertainty is over, markets tend to begin rising again. These short-term falls are a natural part of investing and are built into our strategy. Our goal is to make sure that your pot grows enough to match or beat the rising cost of living. How is my pension pot protected from these events? We protect your savings in 3 ways. 1. We invest your money for your long-term future, helping your pension pot grow steadily over years, or even decades. This means we don\u2019t need to react to short-term changes in the market, which can often lead to poor decisions. 2. We spread your risk by putting your money into more markets than the average pension provider - so when one market is struggling, any drop in value should be balanced by the other markets that you\u2019re invested in. This is the investment equivalent of making sure we don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading your money into lots of baskets means that even if one of them falls, you haven\u2019t lost everything. 3. We only work with the top investment experts in each market you\u2019re invested in. For example, specialists in property manage any real estate deals, and the world\u2019s leading fund managers in stocks handle any investments in the stock market. It means your money is in the best possible hands. Where is my pension pot invested? Over 99% of our members are invested in one of our flagship Nest Retirement Date Funds. You can find out the specific fund you\u2019re in by logging in to your online account. We\u2019ve designed these funds so they shouldn\u2019t be too affected by short-term falls in the stock market. If you\u2019re in the Nest Higher Risk Fund or the Nest Sharia Fund, you might see bigger falls in your pension pot. That\u2019s because a larger proportion of your money is invested in company shares, which are more affected by uncertainty than other markets. However, your pension is likely the longest-term investment you\u2019ll make. Short-term changes to the market may not affect what you\u2019ll get when you retire. To find out which investment markets your fund invests in, check out our [quarterly investment reports](https://www.nestpensions.org.uk/schemeweb/nest/nestcorporation/investment-approach/fund-factsheets.html) . They\u2019ll give you a regular breakdown into where your money is invested and how your fund is performing. How much do I have saved in my pension pot? [Log in to your Nest account](https://www.nestpensions.org.uk/user/login) to find out. Should I switch funds? We believe our flagship Nest Retirement Date Funds work for most people. Our investment strategy has been carefully designed to handle any potential temporary falls in the markets. If you\u2019re looking for guidance for your specific circumstances, then it might be worth discussing your options for a financial adviser or exploring [MoneyHelper](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/) . You\u2019ll find more information on our [Guidance and advice](https://www.nestpensions.org.uk/schemeweb/nest/about-pensions/guidance-and-advice.html) webpage. There\u2019s uncertainty in the markets and I\u2019m close to needing to use my pension savings to live off. Should I be worried? If you\u2019re seeing major changes to the markets when you\u2019re close to needing your pension, we understand this can be stressful. We\u2019re here to offer help and support. Over 99% of our members are in one of our Nest Retirement Date Funds. Ten years before your Nest retirement date, we start moving your money into investments that should keep your money safer. This is known as lifestyling, and it keeps your pot protected from unpredictable changes to the markets. It\u2019s one of the reasons we recommend you keep your Nest retirement date in line with your future plans. If you\u2019ve chosen a different Nest fund, not all of them are lifestyled and it may be worth checking your fund matches the level of risk you\u2019d like to take. Finally, the longer you save, the more time you\u2019ll have for your pension pot to grow in order to make up for any losses. As always, the best course of action is to seek independent, expert guidance for your specific circumstances. [MoneyHelper](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/) may be able to point you in the right direction. There\u2019s uncertainty in the markets and I\u2019d like to transfer my pot. What are the risks? When markets are quickly rising and falling in price, this is known as 'high volatility'. It means that market prices change quickly from day to day, hour to hour, or even minute to minute. When you transfer your pension pot, all investments in your current scheme are sold at the market rate that day. The money is then used to buy different investments in your new pension scheme. If markets move significantly during the time it takes to complete your transfer, you risk locking in any investment losses. We recommend you get free, impartial guidance from [MoneyHelper](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/) or discuss your options with an FCA regulated financial adviser before you transfer your money."
